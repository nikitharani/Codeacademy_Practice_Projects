# Codeacademy_Practice_Projects
These are code academy practice projects(JavaScript,C#,python & Java)

## Number_Guesser(JavaScript)
This is a small guessing game.I have used JavaScript Functions to simulate the game.
1) generateTarget() function will be called at the start of each new round in order to generate the new secret target number.
2) compareGuesses() function will be called each round to determine which guess is closest to the target number.
3) updateScore() function will be used to update the winner's score after each round.
4) advanceRound() function will update the round number after each round.

## Magic 8-Ball(Java)
In this program computer will generate a random number and switch statement is used to output a random piece of advice.

## Games of chance(python)
Here I am using python functions to simulate games of chance.The following games are implemented in this python project
a) flipping-coin
b) cho-Han
c) random picking card
d) roulette 

## Become a pokemon master(python)
Here in this project, trainer and pokemon classes are implemented. The trainer with his pokemon attacks another trainer's pokemon.

## Console Game(c#)
In this project, used C# methods to create a game in console. In the game, you control the character with the keyboard. Up moves the character up, left moves the character left, etc. Close the game by pressing Q or CTRL + C.
1) UpdatePosition() method  will be used to change the position of the character based on keyboard input.
2) UpdateCursor() method  will allow the player icon to change with each keypress.
3) KeepInBounds() method  Without this method, hitting the boundaries will break the game.
4) DidScore() method will allow the score to increase if the character hits the @ object.
